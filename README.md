    Simple linear regression is an algorithm which is used for predictive analysis by establishing a linear relationship between the independent variable(x) and the dependent variable(y).
    y_pred=mx+b where y_pred is the predicted value and x is the input variable
    The slope m and intercept b of the bestfit line are calculated by minimizing the mean squared error which is given by: MSE = $1/N$ $\sum_{k=1}^n \left(y<sub>i</sub> - \left(mx<sub>i</sub> +b\right)\right)$
