    Simple linear regression is an algorithm which is used for predictive analysis by establishing a linear relationship between the independent variable(x) and the dependent variable(y).
    
    y_pred=mx+b where y_pred is the predicted value and x is the input variable
    
    The slope m and intercept b of the bestfit line are calculated by minimizing the mean squared error which is given by:  
    MSE = $1/N$ $\sum_{k=1}^n$ (y<sub>i</sub> - (mx<sub>i</sub> +b)<sup>2</sup>) 
    
    The program takes input a dataset having years of experience and salary as attributes and the goal is to establish salary as a linear function of number of years of experience so that we can predict the salary.
    
    The functions are used for calculating the values of coefficients of best fit line and the model can be deployed on a single value point as well as an array of values.
    
    The rsquare value of the model shows its accuracy.
